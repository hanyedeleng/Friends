\subsection*{[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are there.]}

\section* \normalsize 
{\bf Monica:} There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\\
{\bf Joey:} Come one, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!\\
{\bf Chandler:} All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\\
{\bf Phoebe:} Wait, does he eat chalk?\\
(The all stare, bemused.)\\
{\bf Phoebe:} Just, cause, I don't want her go through what I went through with Carl-oh!\\
{\bf Monica:} Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\\
{\bf Chandler:} Sounds like a date to me.\\
\\
(Time Lapse)\\
{\bf Chandler:} Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\\
{\bf All:} Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\\
{\bf Chandler:} Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\\
{\bf Joey:} Instead of...?\\
{\bf Chandler:} That's right.\\
{\bf Joey:} Never had that dream.\\
{\bf Phoebe:} No.\\
{\bf Chandler:} All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\\
{\bf Monica:} And they weren't looking at you before?!\\
{\bf Chandler:} Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because she never calls me!\\
\\
(Time Lapse. Rose has entered.)\\
{\bf Ross:} (mortified) Hi.\\
{\bf Joey:} This guy says hello, i wanna kill myself.\\
{\bf Monica:} Are you okay, sweetie?\\
{\bf Ross:} I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\\
{\bf Chandler:} Cookie?\\
{\bf Monica:} (explaining to the others) Carol moved her stuff out today.\\
{\bf Joey:} Ohh.\\
{\bf Monica:} (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.\\
{\bf Ross:} Thanks.\\
{\bf Phoebe:} Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air just in front of Ross.)\\
{\bf Ross:} No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\\
{\bf Phoebe:} Fine! Be murky!\\
{\bf Ross:} I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\\
{\bf Monica:} No you don't.\\
{\bf Ross:} No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\\
{\bf Joey:} And you never knew she was a lesbian...\\
{\bf Ross:} No!! Okay? Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\\
{\bf Chandler:} Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?\\
{\bf Ross:} I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\\
{\bf Monica:} Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M. "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?\\
{\bf Ross:} Sorry.\\
{\bf Joey:} Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\\
(Ross gestures his consent.)\\
{\bf Joey:} Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\\
{\bf Ross:} I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\\
\\
(Rachel enters in a wet wedding dress and starts to search the room.)\\
{\bf Chandle:} And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)\\
{\bf Monica:} Rachel?!\\
{\bf Rachel:} Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\\
{\bf Waitress:} Can I get you some coffee?\\
{\bf Monica:} (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survior. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and you remember my brother Ross?\\
{\bf Rachel:} Hi, sure!\\
{\bf Ross:} Hi.\\
(They go to hug but Ross's umbrella opens. He sits back down defeated again. A moment of silence follows as Rachel sits and the others expect her to explain.)\\
{\bf Monica:} So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\\
{\bf Rachel:} Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-(to the waitress that brought her coffee) Sweet 'n' Lo? - I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just din't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived in the city.\\
{\bf Monica:} Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\\
{\bf Rachel:} Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...\\
(Scene: Monica's Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV and are trying to figure out what is going on.)\\
{\bf Monica:} Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.\\
{\bf Chandler:} (imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad? Decide!\\
{\bf Ross:} (in a deep voice) I'll have whatever Christine is having.\\
{\bf Rachel:} (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!\\
