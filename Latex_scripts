\section* \normalsize 
{\bf Monica:} There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\\
{\bf Joey:} Come one, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!\\
{\bf Chandler:} All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\\
{\bf Phoebe:} Wait, does he eat chalk?\\
(The all stare, bemused.)\\
{\bf Phoebe:} Just, cause, I don't want her go through what I went through with Carl-oh!\\
{\bf Monica:} Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\\
{\bf Chandler:} Sounds like a date to me.\\
\\
(Time Lapse)\\
{\bf Chandler:} Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\\
{\bf All:} Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\\
{\bf Chandler:} Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\\
{\bf Joey:} Instead of...?\\
{\bf Chandler:} That's right.\\
{\bf Joey:} Never had that dream.\\
{\bf Phoebe:} No.\\
{\bf Chandler:} All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\\
{\bf Monica:} And they weren't looking at you before?!\\
{\bf Chandler:} Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because she never calls me!\\
\\
(Time Lapse. Rose has entered.)\\
